# ChatApp
Developed a Simple Chat Application to furnish my skills in React, Node and Express<br>
This app is not yet connected to a database, so the messages will get deleted if you leave or even refresh the room.<br>
You can find the deployed version of the App here --> <a>https://noob-chat.netlify.app/</a><br>
The App's Backend has been deployed on Heroku --> <a>https://chat-app-by-iman.herokuapp.com/</a>


* The links no longer work since Heroku discontinued it's free tier *
